SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol 
that enables two computers to communicate 
c.f http or hypertext transfer protocol, 
which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages and share data.

ssh -> we can access remote server ->ppk

what is the pem?
------------------
PEM stands for Privacy Enhanced Mail. The PEM format is often used to represent certificates, certificate requests, certificate chains, and keys.

what is the ppk?
-------------------
PPK files are PuTTY Private Key Files developed by Putty and they serve as storage for the private keys the program generated. These files are used to enable communication securely with another party having the corresponding public key. ... The putty software is the main application using PPK files.

Practice
--------
Ec2 - connect - where is the my pem and ppk file.

ls -ltra

git --version

sudo yum install git -y

yum remove git -y
yum clean git 


Nginx server(service and systemctl)
------------
systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

netstart --help
netstart -nlpt  ->TCP ports running
netstart -nlp

sudo yum install nginx1

sudo ^Vyum install nginx


httpd apache web server (ami linux)
-----------------------
sudo yum install httpd -y

sudo systemctl start httpd

sudo sytemctl status httpd

we can go to google browser paste public ip:port(80)


Nginx in ubuntu server(ubuntu server)
-----------------------
sudo apt install update
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo apt start nginx
sudo apt status nginx


we can go to google browser paste public-> ip:port(80)	


systemctl and service differences
---------------------------------
what is the systemctl?
->The systemctl command is a utility which is responsible for examining and controlling the systemd system and service manager. 
It is a collection of system management libraries, utilities and daemons which function as a successor to the System V init daemon.

sudo systemctl status httpd
-------------------------------

what is service in linux?
->A service is a program that runs in the background outside the interactive control of system users as they lack an interface. ...
 On the other hand, in systems like Unix or Linux, the services are also known as daemons. 
 Sometimes the name of these services or daemons ends with the letter d

sudo service httpd status
-------------------------

ps command -> process
---------------------
ps -ef (all servicing in process)

ps -ef | grep httpd

ps -ef | grep java


we want to kill the process
---------------------------
ps -ef | grep nginx

kill -9 6789   ->(id number kill)

sudo kill -9 6789   ->(id number kill)

rest api -> http(protocol) api (webservice) ->one applicaton to another applicaton communicate via http api.(old webservice soap) now days micro service webservice.

wget -> mainly purpose download (zip.file,tar file unzip)
curl -> get,put,post,delete


one of the apache tomcat server we can copy tar file 
-----------------------------------------------------
wget https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.48/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.48.tar.gz


we want remove apache-tomcat-9.0.48.tar.gz
------------------------------------------
rm -rf apache-tomcat-9.0.48.tar.gz  (dont use any way sudo in realtime senario)

we can download through curl command apache tomcat serevr(this is ask to output so we can put to -O it will store in output)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl https://downloads.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.48/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.48.tar.gz -O

rm pache-tomcat-9.0.48.tar.gz

we can how to create cp (copy command)
---------------------------------------
cd vijay
in vijay : cd docker
in docker: cd kubernetes

mkdir jijay/docker/kubernetes/


vi sample.txt
  hi everyone
  
escape and save :wq

ls -ltra

pwd


we want copy file sample.txt to jijay/docker/kubernetes/mkdir jijay/docker/kubernetes/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cp sample.txt vijay/docker/kubernetes/
cp sample.txt vijay/docker/kubernetes/madhu.txt

cd vijay/docker/kubernetes/

pwd

ls -ltra

cat sample.txt
  the containt also same in madhu.txt
  
cat madhu.txt
   the containt same from sample.txt
   
we can copy madhu.txt file to home folder(till{~/} symbol is home folder)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[kubernetes]$ cp mdhu.txt ~/

ls -ltra

cd means got home folder
------------------------
cd 

ls -ltra

pwd

we can also sample.txt file to copy home folder in tiger
----------------------------------------------------------

cd vijay/docker/kubernetes/sample.txt tiger

cp -r vijay/ tiger/    [entire vijay folder to copy in tiger folder -r means recursive that is folder inside files]

cd tiger

ls -ltra

mv command(rename file) mv source to destination file 
--------------------------------------------
mv madhu.txt madhu1.txt

ls -ltra

we can use same in directory
-----------------------------
mv vijay vijay1

ls -ltra

Now adduser ,passwd and su(switch user)
---------------------------

   linux admin 
         |
developer want test apps in linux server so linux admin never ever share pem file since 
if any developer can change in this serevr is effected by linux admin so 
we can create publickey to developer to accecss server for test app.
	 
 
ssh-keygen -> entire ansible dependes on this keygen
  

adduser akshay
sudo adduser akshay

sudo passwd akshay

we can set password
--------------------

su akshay

ask the password

cd 

pwd

akshay come home folder 
------------------------
ls -ltra

we can  come out this akshay user not server what we can use command
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
exit

we can switch to akshay
------------------------

su akshay

this above command /ec2-user/
---------------------------------

su - akshay

this above command directly come akshay
------------------------------------------



23/june/2021
-----------------

chmod (change mode)

we can create one file 
-----------------------
vijay.txt

ls -ltra

-rw-rw-r-- [user,group,others]

r->read  ->4
w->write  ->2
x->exutable ->1
- -> nothing -> 0

what is the default value in  AMI Linux permission
-rw-rw-r-- [664] AMI linux permission

664 -->AMI linux 
umask -> 002

 
666[File has 666 default value permission]
 022 -->umask (default umask)
 644

we can search umask value in file
----------------------------------
cat /etc/bashrc

vi /etc/bashrc

umask 024
vi sample.txt
ls -ltra

 642
   024 ->umask value


ls -ltra

-rw-rw-r-- vijay.txt

What is the difference between umask and chmod?

 umask sets the default permissions for your files when they are created, 
   while chmod is used to change the file permissions after they are created. 
    the OS which is 777 for directories and 666 for files in linux.

What is default Umask?

 By default, the system sets the permissions on a text file to 666, 
  which grants read and write permission to user, group, and others, 
    and to 777 on a directory or executable file. ... The value assigned by the umask command is subtracted from the default

How do I create a user Umask?
  There are three normal ways to set a user's umask.
    1)Set UMASK in /etc/login.defs.
    2)Add pam_umask.so to your PAM configuration in /etc/pam.d.
    3)Set it in the shell startup files, e.g. /etc/profile.
	
	
we what change mode only read
-------------------------------

chmod 400 vijay.txt

ls -ltra

-r-------- vijay.txt

we only read above file we cant change in the file


700 [read,write,exutable] permission

chmod 700 vijay.txt
 
  this file vijay will change
  
754->(read,write,exutable),(read,exutable),(read)

777 [Folder has default value permission]  	

we can create one folder default umask value
---------------------------------------------
777
775 ->002 umask
755
022->umask default value

practices
----------
ls -ltra

ls -ltri   ->(inode value)(FYI Two Same inode values that is Hardlinkfile and softlink file is l symbol)

inode means unique value

we can create file1.txt (sfile1.txt) and file2.txt (hfile2.txt)
---------------------------------------------------------------
vi file1.txt
 
  this is line1 of the file1
  
  :wq

vi file2.txt
  
 this is line1 of the file2
  
 :wq

ln -s file1.txt sfile1.txt 

ln file2.txt hfile2.txt

ls -ltra

ls -ltri   (we can find hard link file via inode and soft link is always l)



vi sfile1.txt

 this is line1 of the file1
 this is line2 of the file1


 :wq
 
cat sfile1.txt
 this is line1 of the file1
 this is line2 of the file1
 
cat file1.txt
   this is line1 of the file1
   this is line2 of the file1 
  
  
vi hfile2.txt
 this is line1 of the file2
 this is line2 of the file2
  
  
 :wq
 
cat hfile2.txt
 this is line1 of the file2
 this is line2 of the file2
 
cat file2.txt 
 this is line1 of the file2
 this is line2 of the file2


rm -rf file2.txt
rm -rf file1.txt

ls -ltra


sfile2.txt -> file1.txt(softlink showing the am dying)
hfile2.txt

cat sfile1.txt  -> its not showing

cat hfile2.txt
  this is line1 of the file2
  this is line2 of the file2


cd /usr/sbin/      -(softlink files list)

writting shell script
----------------------
why-> we want execute multiple linux commands,i would like to let say ,
example, one folder is a inside many files we want delete and at time to copy another folder,that why we use shell script
application repeted again again same task we use shell script


Progrma file exetation
-------------------------
.sh
.java
.py
.tf

lets start (echo means println echo statement)
-------------
vi hello.ssh

#!/bin/bash
 echo "hello guys"
 
 :wq
 
sh hello.sh
 o/p - hello guys

without #!.bin/bash can we excute script->yes  we can excute (bash is old ,new sh)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vi hello.sh

echo "hello guys"

sh hello.sh

or
--
we can execute like 

/bin/bash hello.sh

out can execute (sh means softlink of the bash)

/bin/sh hello.sh

ls -ltr /bin/     -> soft link of details

bash one kind of program executable soft link of sh
--------------------------------------------------
we nwant IP address

nslookup DomainName	

nslookup en.wikipedia.org  ->we cat get Public ip address (static host name or IP  address)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nslookup google.com

without sh hello.sh instead of the ./hello.sh -> permision denied 
------------------------------------------------------------------
we are telling the system i am writing the shell script just we are telling the understand 
to kernel(is written in c langauge that can understand they are writting shell script or others) bash is system software.



we can try execute with permision what we can do -> 
---------------------------------------------------
ls -ltra

hello.sh  -> -rw-rw-r-- 

we can make it without shebang permision what we can use (executable permission)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
chmod +X hello.sh 

we can also use (777) yes we can use
------------------------------------
./hello.sh

now we can execute output(interpreter means compiler that is shebang (#!/bin/bash))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
this is interview questions
------------------------------
#!/bin/bash means
-------------------
shebang #!/ that is interpreter to call executable permission to program

this is interview questions
-------------------------------
without #!/bin/bash can write execute program -yes 
--------------------------------------------------- 
we can use chmod +x execute permission and file or 777 (read,write and execute)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./hello.sh that script can execute
----------------------------------



another one example (static value)
---------------------------------
vi addition.sh
 
#!/bin/bash
 ((sum = 20+30))
  echo $sum
  
  
chmod +x addition.sh

./addition.sh

50  
  
  
we can use variable a=20 and b-30
-----------------------------------
vi addition.sh
 
#!/bin/bash
a=20
b=30
 ((sum = a+b))
  echo $sum
  

we can use variable a=$1 and b=$2
----------------------------------
vi addition.sh
 
#!/bin/bash
a=$1
b=$2
 ((sum = a+b))
  echo $sum
  
we can pass arguments value (dyanamic values)
---------------------------------------------
./addition.sh 20 30

50

./addition.sh 30 50  ->(command line arguments)

80

we can copy the addition to multifiction
-----------------------------------------
cp addition.sh multi.sh         ->(addition.sh default permission give to multi.sh)
----------------------------

but copy new create vi hello2.sh from hello.sh  since not default permission
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

vi hello2.sh

ls -ltra

cp addition.sh hello2.sh

rm -rf hello2.sh

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS OF THE Linux
--------------------------------

1)What is the boot process in Linux?
the boot process in Linux
----------------------------
->	1)BIOS. BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. ...
    2)MBR. MBR stands for Master Boot Record, and is responsible for loading and executing the GRUB boot loader. ...
    3)GRUB. ...
    4)Kernel. ...
    5)Init. ...
    6)Runlevel programs	
	
	and
	Steps In the Booting Process
	-------------------------------
	1: BIOS and Setup Program.
    2: The Power-On-Self-Test (POST)
    3: The Operating System (OS) Loads.
    4: System Configuration.
    5: System Utility Loads.
    6: Users Authentication.
	
2)How to create zero size file Linux?
->we are create empty file in Linux using touch command.

3)What is soft link and hard link? How to create? What is the difference between these two?
->A symbolic or soft link is an actual link to the original file, 
   whereas a hard link is a mirror copy of the original file. 
  If you delete the original file, the soft link has no value,because it points to a non-existent file


How to create
--------------
this is for the softlink
---------------------------
ln -s file1.txt  sfile1.txt


this is for the hardlink
------------------------
ln file2.txt hfile2.txt


What is the difference between these two
---------------------------------------------	
Comparison Parameters	         Hard link	                                     Soft link
File system	                    It cannot be used across file systems.	         It can be used across file systems.

  inode          inode
    |              |
hardlink    my file.txt<-softlink

4)What is first line written in shell script? What is the meaning of that? If I didn’t write that line what will happen? Then how to run the script?
->
first line written in shell script
---------------------------------- 
#!/bin/bash

meaning that
------------



5)How to run a shell script in background?
->5 Ways to Execute UNIX / Linux Commands (and Shell Scripts) in Background
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1)Execute a command in the background using & ...
  2)Execute a command in the background using nohup. ...
  3)Execute a command using screen command. ...
  4)Executing a command as a batch job using at. ...
  5)Execute a command continuously using watch.

6)What is cron tab? Explain it? How to configure the schedule a job?
-> crontab ->shedular
-------------------------
go to web site crontab.guru
---> shedular
              minute    hour   dom   moy   dow
                *       *      *      *     *
              0-59     0-23    1-31  1-12   0-7


*  *  *  *  *      delete_yesterday_logfile.sh  ->12am 



crontab -l

crontab -e


 */1 * * * *  /home/ec2-user/hello.sh >> result.txt
 
  :wq

we wait for 1 minute since already set 1 minute
  
ls
  
cat result.txt

  this is devops class


we after 1 minute one more same line add 

cat result.txt
 
 this is devops class
 this is devops class

How to configure the schedule a job
------------------------------------
The cron daemon is a long-running process that executes commands at specific dates and times. 
You can use this to schedule activities, either as one-time events or as recurring tasks. 
To schedule one-time only tasks with cron, use the at or batch command.

7)How to allow the ports in Linux?
->sudo ufw allow ssh


8)How to trouble shoot the remote server having some issue?
->trouble shoot the remote server having some issue
----------------------------------------------------
  #1: Use ping command
 ---------------------
Always ping the IP address of server and then try hostname. For example:
$ ping 75.126.43.232
$ ping cyberciti.biz

If you can ping by IP address but not by hostname, 
then make sure you have correct DNS name servers setup in /etc/resolv.conf file.

$ less /etc/resolv.conf
-----------------------

Output:

nameserver 192.168.1.10
nameserver 208.67.222.222

 #2: Use traceroute command
----------------------------
If you cannot ping your server at all, use traceroute to trace network problem.

 $ traceroute cyberciti.biz
 
 
 #3: Look for default route / gateway IP
-----------------------------------------
If traceroute point out that you cannot reach to your own gateway, 
then check routing setting on your own workstation 
# route
# route add default gw 192.168.1.254 eth0

 #4: Look for IP address
-------------------------
Make sure you have correct IP address assigned by DHCP server. 
Some time network admin make changes to DHCP server or changes IP routing or other stuff. 
It is a good idea to restart network interface:

# /etc/init.d/network restart
# tail -f /var/log/message
# ifconfig -a
# route


 #5: Check for network cables and power supply
-----------------------------------------------
#6: Check firewall log
Make sure your own firewall is not blocking access to remote server. Just try to stop your firewall.
# iptables -L -n
# tail -f /var/log/messages
# /etc/init.d/iptables stop

If you are using Cisco PIX or dedicated Linux / OpenBSD box as firewall, check logs for more information.

 #7: Connect to correct ports
--------------------------------
Most service connects to default port such as
HTTP – port 80
Proxy – port 3128
SSH – port 22
FTP – port 21

Sometime you change default ports to increase security, so make sure you are connecting to correct remote port.
